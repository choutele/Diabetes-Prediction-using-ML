# Diabetes-Prediction-using-ML

The necessity of regulating and controlling diabetes is crucial for individuals who have it to live a healthy and comfortable lifestyle. The illness known as diabetes is characterized by excessive blood sugar levels in patients who have insufficient amounts of the hormone insulin in their bodies. Because of the impact that high blood sugar levels have on the body, diabetes can lead to a variety of problems, the severity of which is proportional to the severity of the disease. Modifications to one's food and way of life, together with routine medical check-ups are all necessary components of long-term diabetes treatment. In this project we aim to create a diabetes prediction model using different machine learning techniques. There are 22 affecting and unaffecting variables that can be found in the dataset, and we are going to examine them carefully. 
Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is the name of the yearly health-related telephone survey that is carried out by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in United States of America. Each year, more than 400,000 people in the United States take part in the survey, giving information regarding health-related risk behaviours, persistent health issues. The main aim of this survey is to collect all the health-related data that can lead to diabetes.
Upon loading and cleaning the dataset, exploratory data analysis is conducted on both binary and non-binary variables. Following testing for unique values and correlation, each variable is individually scrutinized to determine its correlations with the target variables. Subsequently, feature selection is carried out, followed by an ANOVA test. Moving on to the target variable, exploratory data analysis is performed. To construct a diabetes prediction model, we have included various models such as random forest, cat boost, xg boost, gaussian nb, logistic regression, and gradient boosting. Employing various sampling techniques, we strive to strike a balance in the target variable and obtain a well-performing model in our quest to identify the best model. Finally, we optimize feature selection techniques and set up a confusion matrix to arrive at the best model. By enabling early diagnosis of diabetes, this model has the potential to protect individuals from developing more severe forms of the condition.
